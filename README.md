## Introduction

This project serves as a foundation for building a simplified Instagram-like application. The database schema is designed to capture key relationships and interactions within a social networking platform. Whether you are a developer looking for a starting point or someone interested in understanding the data structure behind a social media app, this project provides a clear and well-documented foundation.

## Database Schema

The schema includes the following tables:

1. **users:** Represents user profiles with unique usernames and creation timestamps.
2. **photos:** Stores image URLs, user associations, and creation timestamps.
3. **comments:** Manages user comments on photos, linked to both users and photos.
4. **likes:** Records user likes on specific photos.
5. **follows:** Establishes follower-followee relationships between users.
6. **tags:** Stores unique tag names associated with photos.
7. **photo_tags:** Connects photos with their corresponding tags.

Each table is structured to maintain data integrity through foreign key relationships, and appropriate indexes are applied to enhance query performance.

## Usage

To use this database schema, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryanbhardwaj24/Instagram_Database_Clone.git

2. **Import the Schema:**
